mid-workout, I space out towards the mirror in front of me.

a woman enters my peripheral, but I'm staring at the space next to her by a very safe margin; phew.

an awkward moment circumvented, but I still want chocolate - 

the chocolate I was thinking of buying before my workout.

an extra 5 - no, possibly 7.83 more minutes for a paltry bar of chocolate?

yes, I weighed the effort and the reward.

as usual, the activation energy for this activity towered my reserves.

<br>

gym to home is a blur. I still want dessert.

i cooked - applaud me. Oats and minced chicken,

but you would've thought it to be porridge.

it's pure genius that I cooked the chicken exactly to the colour of the burnt oats.

intentional, artful, genius. How are you going to refute that anyway?

dinner, coffee, and DESSERT. I WANT DESSERT.

<br>

i simultaneously heat my dinner and make my french press coffee. 

peak efficiency, like the scheduling algorithm for a multicore operating system -

is what I think to myself while looking at the tens of utensils in the sink I used to make bloody oats.

not to mention the stains on the kitchen counter.

phone out, I look for the cheapest sweet item. 

yeah, I already spent too much today.

<br>

apple pie's on an offer but the clock strikes seven and the offer vanishes.

signs from the universe; maybe I shouldn't eat more, spend more.

I turn the fan on because I've been ignoring the heat too long 

to focus on optimizing for the best value dessert.

heavy rain transpires and I couldn't force the poor delivery person through the storm.

signs from the universe; maybe I shouldn't eat more, spen- no wait; it's just the sound of the fan.

<br>

i've been deciding too long, just order already.

brownie from a well-respected bakery. It ought to be good, don't think.

shower, finally. 

<br>

> ~! A wave of loneliness hits. !~

>> i feel a physical drainage of life from my brain.

>> what does it take to be able to connect with others.

>> is there no one. 

>>> why is there a cubicle surrounding my sole existence.

>>> i am longing...

gotta write this down, write this down - 

	mid-workout, I space out tow ~~~~~ !!!

## this brownie is painfully average.
