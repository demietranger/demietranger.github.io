I want to control you, but I am weak.

I cannot order you around.

I curse you with empty words and ideas, where

Adversity has no bound.

<br>

Listen to me, else endless suffering will befall you.

Listen to me, abandoning reason.

Don't dare argue, or I'll self destruct.

I will not stand for such treason.

<br>

Everyone else is wrong, but I am perfect.

Second only to God.

I worship Him every day and every night,

But alas, I am downtrod.

<br>

Should've listened to me; now you suffer.

I am the oracle who knows all.

I only meant to help you,

But now it's time for you to fall.
