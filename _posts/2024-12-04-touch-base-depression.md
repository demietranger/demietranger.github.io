Home, sweet home.

Every now and then I pay a visit

to that alluring abyss,

so difficult to leave behind.

<br>


The road there is straight and singular,

without speed limits.

Slow or fast,

the destination is inevitable.

<br>


At home I'm hit by a wave

of familiarity.

The familiar air

of despair.

<br>


About to head out,

I step through the front door;

but I can't yet leave,

as I've forgotten my keys.

<br>


So I step back in

and take a seat for a minute;

tradition

to ward off misfortune.

<br>


Now to search for my keys,

nowhere to be found;

which I swear I had left

on my study desk;

<br>


I take my seat again,

this time to collect my thoughts;

but my thoughts are scattered

and my focus, shattered.

<br>


I can't leave home;

but oh, how I need to,

for I'm late to be elsewhere.

Instead, I'm stuck in despair.

<br>


I mustn't delay further,

though I know not where I'm going.

I leave the door wide open,

but one thing is for certain.

<br>


My home is safe and sound,

as no one wishes to enter

this abode, old and decrepit,

that I will soon revisit.
