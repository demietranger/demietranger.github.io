new human comes into my life

new human kinda cute

new human starts off distant, but eventually

> We form a slightly more than superficial connection involving more than exchanging pleasantries.

<br>

new human and I talk lots, but

new human already committed. Oh no,

new human still always yapping, but

> I mustn't get attached, lest I go into a deep depression from the inevitable falling out.

<br>

new human knows me for some time now, but

new human drifts away.

new human makes me somber about

> Subtly but noticeably reducing their interaction with me.

<br>

```But one day...```

<br>

flashy new human enters the scene.

new human intrigued.

flashy new human looks better than me.

> There's a stark shift in their attention towards the exotic entrant.

<br>

new human cancels plans with me because

new human is suddenly busy.

new human declines me ever so politely so

> The two of them can discreetly keep each other company once I leave.

<br>

new human no longer committed.

new human and flashy always together.

new human is happy.

> Crippling feelings of inadequacy wreak havoc on my mind and body.
