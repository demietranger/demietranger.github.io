I have dreams, ambitions, desires, grand ideas.

I imagine a future filled with accomplishments. I’m capable, intelligent, strong, motivated. I will be the greatest. What could possibly stop me?

Competition? Not a chance. I’ll crush them to dirt. I’m better than everyone.

Failure? How can I fail? I will get what I desire.

The universe? The universe can be my enemy. I am alone at the summit. Only I can make myself fall.

Only I can make myself fall. So I jump.

And look back as I accelerate. Just to realise I was never at the summit. The universe is much vaster; much too vast to take on.

My ambitions disappear behind the clouds. Out of sight, out of mind. I desire nothing in life.

Chronic illness, the great destroyer of ego.

I assimilate into the dirt, crushed by myself. I am reduced to almost nothing. Unfortunately, almost.

Destroy me completely, as there is still a sliver of ego.

And once again I will rise to the illusory summit. And look down from my small rock.
