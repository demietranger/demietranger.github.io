Sorry, but I don't feel a semblance of connection with you.

I can only empathize with your condition - the same one that befalls me.

But I cannot be your soother.

For that would drive me to the depths of discontent.

And I'm much too selfish to consider you, the one I don't feel a semblance of connection with.

<br>

Sorry, but I don't want to pour my emotions out to you,

Because you're not the one I can trust with my emotions.

You can only deflect them and foster self-pity,

While you display a facade of worry,

But never concern.

<br>

Folly, that it hurts to detach from you.

But the curse of familiarity can bind souls otherwise conflicted.

I sometimes dream of us never having known each other,

So we can go our separate ways,

Without the overbearing thought of abandonment.
