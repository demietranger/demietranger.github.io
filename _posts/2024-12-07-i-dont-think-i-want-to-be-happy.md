I think I want to be happy, and nothing else.

If I crash and burn then so be it. Iâ€™d rather not analyze how I feel every moment, in trepidation of my downfall.

The body is trivial. A slave to the mind. The mind can destroy; cripple your body with mere thought. 

Why think? It's useless. The greatest philosophers are the saddest. The absence of thought is bliss.
