Fear not, I am here with my wisdom.

Though about your worry I know nothing at all,

I have countless stories of conquest to recall.

<br>

You and I, we're exactly the same.

Though you are slightly lesser,

As I have more knowledge to lecture.

<br>

Your problems are small and silly.

Mine are a burden too immense

For my wisdom to make any sense.

<br>

Your advice is full of ignorance.

You do not understand my plight.

I must stand on my own shoulders and fight.
